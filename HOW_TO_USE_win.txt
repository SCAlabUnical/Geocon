	INTRODUCTION

Geocon is a Framework for geolocalised applications.
It’s based on Elasticsearch and it’s written in Java.
It exposes a RESTful API for interfacing custom software with the Framework, it’s easy to use and configure.

After reading this document, please read the README-Installation file.

	TECH DETAILS

Geocon is based on Elasticsearch, a powerful NoSQL database and search engine.
Thanks to the technology introduced by Elasticsearch, it’s possible to store schema-free 
JSON objects - indexing and searching them really fast.

Since this version has as target the developing of a geolocalised tourism-oriented application,
a suggested schema is provided - and implemented out of the box.
Please refer to SCHEMAS file inside this folder.

With the default configuration, you’re going to have a web service working and running simply
running the jar file “geocon.jar”. It’s suggested though to fill the database with some example data. 

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Enter in the Elasticsearch folder (e.g.: zip/Elasticsearch-1.4.4)
2. Run the Elasticsearch node (usually ./bin/elasticsearch)
For details on this part, please read the README-Installation file.
3. Fill the database with examples:
	type in a console “java -jar geocon.jar fill” without quotes
	insert the USERS path (e.g: zip/examples/utenti) and hit return
	insert the EVENTS path (e.g: zip/examples/eventi) and hit return
	insert the PLACES path (e.g: zip/examples/posti) and hit return
	insert the RESOURCES path (e.g: zip/examples/risorse) and hit return
4. Start the web service
	in a console, type “java -jar geocon.jar”
5. The web service is now running and it will refer to an example database composed of
200 users, 100 events, 100 places and 100 resources.

A simple password authentication tool is included in this version of the software.
For every created user, a default password “prova” is set. This password
will be used for some CRUD operations. Detailed information are available in the next chapter.

Please note that this authentication method is for demonstration purpose only. It’s
highly not recommended to use it as a primary authentication method.

	Examples & Uses

Prerequisites: the database is filled with the suggested schema.
		You have the default configuration in “config.properties” file
		(for detailed information, please read the README-Installation file)
		You’re also using a
		REST client. Suggested software: CocoaRestClient (Mac OS X)
		Advanced Rest Client (Chrome web browser extension)

Welcome message: http://localhost:8080/geocon/

1* Read from the resources. GET method on USERS/EVENTS/RESOURCES/PLACES

METHOD: GET
URL: http://localhost:8080/geocon/users/35
HEADER: empty

You’ll be able to read the information of the user with ID 35.

METHOD: GET
URL: http://localhost:8080/geocon/events/12
HEADER: empty

You’ll be able to read the information of the event with ID 12.

METHOD: GET
URL: http://localhost:8080/geocon/resources/1
HEADER: empty

You’ll be able to read the information of the resource with ID 1.


METHOD: GET
URL: http://localhost:8080/geocon/places/60
HEADER: empty

You’ll be able to read the information of the event with ID 60.

2* Create a new resource. POST method on USERS/EVENTS/RESOURCES/PLACES

METHOD: POST
URL: http://localhost:8080/geocon/users?password=test
HEADER: Content-Type = application/json
PAYLOAD: { “name" : {
    "last" : "Mcconnell",
    "first" : "Barrett"
  }

It creates a new user with password set to “test”. As you can see, the example user DOESN’T
respect the suggested schema. This is not a problem because Elasticsearch is schema-free.

3* Update a resource. PUT method on USERS/EVENTS/RESOURCES/PLACES

METHOD: PUT
URL: http://localhost:8080/geocon/resources/18
Header: Content-Type : application/json
PAYLOAD:
 {
  "location" : "event",
  "date" : "2014-12-16T22:28:42.946Z",
  "text" : "ciao a tutti belli e brutti",
  "user_id" : 68,
  "path" : "http://placehold.it/image.jpg",
  "location_id" : 63
}

Resource with ID 18 is overwritten.

4* Delete a resource

METHOD: DELETE
URL: http://localhost:8080/geocon/events/70
Header: empty
PAYLOAD: empty

Delete the event with ID 70.

5* Search a resource

METHOD: GET
URL: http://localhost:8080/geocon/search?q=…&type=…&size=…
Header: empty
PAYLOAD: empty

After the q parameters, you can write whichever Elasticsearch DSL query.
It’s strongly suggested to take a look to Elasticsearch documentation on
www.elastic.co

You can search in all the index wide or specify a type with the “type” parameter.
You can also override the default size of the query result (that usually is 10)
with the “size” parameter.

	Administrative work

If you want to change password for users, the only way is to interact with Elasticsearch
directly. It’s suggested to install Marvel (and Sense with) as explained in the
README-Installation file.

If for some reason you want to delete the index, you can send a DELETE HTTP request
@ cluster_address:cluster_port/geocon
